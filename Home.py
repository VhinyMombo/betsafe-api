### The Application

This app is under development by Vhiny MOMBO, applied mathematics engineer and Data 
Scientist from [ENSIIE](https://www.ensiie.fr/) and 
[Paris Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). 
During his study, he learnt Quantitative finance and Risk management.
This why he implemented this solution which will help you to bet safer
by losing less while having a good expectation to win.
### The Analysis
The solution proposed for each bet use Risk Management theory and Probability
properties.

### Data

For this version 1.0, all you have to do is to follow the instructions step by step
You have to provide your odds (you can find it on the pages of your favorite boookmaker) and the 
probability for each events (if you have it, [coteur](https://www.coteur.com/) is a good provider, otherwise let the algorithm do it for you.)
